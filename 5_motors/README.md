# 5. Two motors

## Description
Two motors connected to a motor shield perform following actions in a loop: both go forward, both go 
backward, one goes forward one - backward and vice-versa. If the wheel platform is used, then it will be: 
platform goes forward, goes backward, turns in one direction, turns in the opposite direction

## Hardware used
* Arduino Uno R3
* Aduino Motor Shield R3
* 2 * DC Motor
* Wheels platform (optional)
* 4 * AA Battery pack (optional)

## New hardware knowledge
* Motor shield
* Battery pack (external power supply)
* DC motors
* analog pins

## New C++ knowledge
* external libraries (custom MotorShield)

## Requirements
* MotorShield library must be imported to Arduino IDE. See libraries/README.md and libraries/MotorShield
