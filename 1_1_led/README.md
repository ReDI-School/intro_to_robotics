## Hardware used: 
* Arduino Uno R3
* Breadboard
* 1 * 1 KOhm resistor
* 1 * LED

## New hardware knowledge
* breadboard,
* digital pins
* LEDs
* resisitors

## New C++ knowledge
* variables (built-in types)
* Arduino functions (setup, loop)

## Notes
* I used 1 KOhm resistor for protecting the LED however any with values 220 Ohm-1 KOhm can be used
