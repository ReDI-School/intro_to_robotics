# Intro to robotics examples

## Description
This is a set of Arduino sketches/c++ code examples which can be used for the introduction 
to Arduino platform and C++ language. 

Each example is stored in a separate folder which name starts with a number. These numbers organize the expected order 
of the examples. 

In every example folder there is a Arduino IDE sketch file (.ino), all the needed C++ code files 
(Arduino IDE opens them automatically on opening .ino file if stored in the same folder) and a folder with the 
hardware sketches, created using [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/).

Every example folder contains also it's own README file with a short description of a project, needed hardware and
used C++ features.

Videos for the examples can be found in [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IM95TeLhyyISlwULM54-3pLDfEiW7HbJ)

The classes which are reused in several examples are situated in the **libraries** folder and can be included as libraries
(.zip files) to Arduino IDE

There is also **class_materials** folder, which contains a [separate repository](https://github.com/ReDI-School/intro_to_robotics_class_materials) added here as a submodule.
Please update it (or better introduce a script for updating it) whenever you add a new example or change the existing one.
