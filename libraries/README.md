# Intro to robotics libraries

## Description
This folder contains C++ classes which are used in several examples and external Arduino libraries. 

The classes I put here **do not pretend to be production quality libraries** (and .zip files don't contain 
all the necessary information - only code). They were puth here just to avoid copying files from one example 
to another.

## Installation
* Option 1: [How to install .zip library in Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4)
* Option 2: copy .h and .cpp files to the folder where .ino file is saved. Then reopen .ino file in Arduino IDE - it will import .h and .cpp files automatically
