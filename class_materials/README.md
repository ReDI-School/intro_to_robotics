# Intro to robotics examples - class materials

## Description
This is an auxiliary repository for [Intro to robotics examples](https://github.com/ReDI-School/intro_to_robotics).

It contains the same examples, but the C++ implementation is removed from .ino files - only libraries and 
helper classes setup is left there.
Sketches are also presented as .png files

This can be given to students or used for live programming session during the class.
